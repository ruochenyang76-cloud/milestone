# Analysis of AI Agent Behaviors in GitHub Pull Requests

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **AIDev dataset**, which documents software development activities performed by AI coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Devin, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex). 

Unlike traditional studies focusing on human developers, this project investigates the behavior, acceptance rates, and workflow patterns of AI agents in real-world GitHub repositories. By examining metadata such as Pull Request (PR) status, agent identity, repository characteristics, and timestamps, we aim to understand how external factors influence the acceptance of AI-generated code contributions.

This project is part of the **DATA 542** course at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

## Research Questions
We focus on three key questions regarding AI agent performance:

1.  **Agent Performance by Language:** How does the programming language of a repository affect the acceptance rate (Merged vs. Closed) of Pull Requests generated by different AI Agents?
2.  **Impact of Repository Popularity:** Is there a correlation between Repository Popularity (Stars) and the "Time-to-Decision" (duration between creation and closure) for AI-generated PRs?
3.  **PR Description Quality:** Does the verbosity of the PR description (Body Length) predict the likelihood of the PR being merged?
